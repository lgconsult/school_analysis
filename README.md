# school_analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the district scores without the suspected manipulated data, and to assess the difference between the two datasets.

## Results
![District Analysis]
- The district results were negligibly affected. The average math score went down by about .05%, average reading score went down by .02%. The percent passing math went down from 74.98 to 74.76% and the percent passing reading went down from 85.81% to 85.66%. The total for passing both was affected the most moving from 65.17% to 64.86%.
- The changes affect Thomas HS summary results but do not affect the results for any other school. Math scores for Thomas High fell by about .1 percent while the average reading score rose, although the percent passing reading fell by .3%. The percent passing both at Thomas High fell by .3%.
- Relative to other schools, Thomas High School's stats fell when replacing ninth grader scores with NaN, although their ranking compared to other schools stayed the same.
- The only scores affected were Thomas High School's 9th grade reading and math scores, all others stayed the same

## Summary
The changes to the data can be summarized as follows. Average math scores at Thomas High fell while average reading scores rose, however the percentage passing of math and reading fell. The percentage passing both math and reading together also fell. The changes had a negligible affect on the rest of the statistics so much so that when rounded to the nearest decimal point, they did not change. When left to four decimal points, the changes corresponded with the categories Thomas High School is associated with. For example, charter high school stats fell on most counts except for average reading % because Thomas High School is a charter school and this corresponds with their results. The same goes for school size, where only medium school stats were affected, and school spending, where only the 631$-645$ were affected.
